  * Means the following is 2x2 matrices


2.  Test Threshold n

    Generates 2 random n*n matrices
    
    Finds a threshold n where Divide-and-Conquer is not needed anymore
    
3.  Test C

    Finds a c where when n is large, the matrices will only need to do c Divide-and-Conquer for the execution time to be lower than traditional matrix multiplication
